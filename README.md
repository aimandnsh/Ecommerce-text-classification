# Ecommerce-text-classification

# Overview
This project aims to classify textual data from eCommerce product descriptions into predefined categories. With the exponential growth of online shopping platforms, categorizing product descriptions accurately can enhance search functionality, improve user experience, and aid in various business intelligence tasks.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of product descriptions from various eCommerce platforms. Each product description is labeled with a category, representing the type of product.

# Proposed Methodology
Model Architecture: A CNN architecture is designed, comprising convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers
